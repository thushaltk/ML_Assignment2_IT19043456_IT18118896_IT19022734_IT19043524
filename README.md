## Project Description
In this Logistic Regression project, we used a dataset from Kaggle which represents the features that can be used to predict whether somebody is a diabetic patient or not and that dataset is available under Kaggle as **"Pima Indians Diabetes Database".**

## Summary
In the end according to the testing results, we got a prediction accuracy level of **76%** for this model, which is good to improve the model further we need to provide more data into the dataset and we also can tryout this logistic regression analysis by using the other machine learning models available in the sci-kit-learn library too.In the classification report, we can see good amounts in the precision which is **0.79** for predicting a patient as not a diabetic patient accurately and **0.71** for predicting a patient as a diabetic patient accurately.Finally we improved the hyperparameters of the logistic regression model and it improved the model a furthermore and gave an accuracy level of **0.78%** over the previous value, **0.77%**.Now we can deploy this logistic regression model for this diabetic patient identification scenario.
